The main problem we wanted to solve is to identify the Parkinson problem exactly so that we could find out the patients and treat them in advance.
Here, we are using some of the algorithms that can help us to identify the  symptoms of the disease by using a dataset that contains the voice that is been spoken by some of the peoplewho have been tested for this disease.
After that analysing the accuracy calculated by using the appropriate algorithms and  a conclusion that what among the choosen algorithm best suits for identifying the disease.
These are the algorithms that we will be implementing on the dataset for building a model: 
Logistic Regression 
Support Vector Machine(SVM) 
Artificial Neural Network(ANN)
Among these Three algorithms "Artificial neural network" gave accuracy more than 90% (i.e ANN gave 93% accuracy).
